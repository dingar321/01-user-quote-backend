## Encountered errors
- PosgreSQL's tool "pgAdmin" didnt sucesfully install on my computer database cluster initialisation failed. So i switched to "Docker" and created a container. After that was created i used an UDM called "DBeaver" to manipulate with my database.
- When trying to generate a new migration, the terminal throws back *Error during migration generation: error: password authentication failed for user "Dino"*. The problem is that the ".env" and "ormconfig.js" file contain a diffrenet user. Still looking for a solution.
