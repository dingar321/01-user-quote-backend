<h1 align="center"> 01-user-quote-backend </h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## General info
This is the first project in the "SkillUp Mentor" program. The assignment is a full-stack application that allows the users to register and login, write *one* paragraph of a motivational quote, view other users quotes and vote on them eq. Upvote and down vote. Technologies that will be used in this project: Typescript NestJs, PostgreSQL, DBeaver, Docker, Swagger.

The main purpose of this project is to learn full-stack development and the workflow that comes with developing full-stack applications. The second purpose is to learn new technologies such as in this case: Typescript NestJs and PostgreSQL as well as many other libraries that are described below.

This repository is the back-end part of the project. It is an API written in NestJs that has a database using PostgreSQL running virtually in a Docker container. To make life easier I am also using a UDT tool called DBeaver to view my database. The database contains two tables "users" and "quotes" that are connected through a one-to-one relation. The passwords are hashed using the Bcrypt library. To test the API I am using the Swagger library.

The front-end part of this project: [01-user-quote-frontend](https://github.com/dingar321/01-user-quote-frontend)

## Setup
The most important requirement is the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) framework installed. We are also goint to configure the ".env" file with the database information and the "docker-compose.yml" to start a PostgreSQL image in a container (both files are located in the root directory). To start the docker image type the command in the CLI  `docker-compose up -d` and if we want to stop it simply type `docker-compose down`. If we ever change the database entities we can simply generate a new migration by typing `npx typeorm migration:generate -n <name>` and to apply the changes type `npx typeorm migration:run`.
